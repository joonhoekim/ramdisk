   - Docker containerization impact appears minimal on M1 Max

3. **Workload Characteristics**
   - Random access performance difference (63x) highlights architectural advantages
   - Sequential access scaling shows memory controller efficiency
   - Latency consistency better on M1 Max across all test scenarios

### Conclusions

The M1 Max demonstrates superior memory performance across all tested scenarios, with particularly impressive advantages in:

- Random access operations (63x improvement)
- Sequential read operations (12x improvement)
- Overall system latency (up to 71x improvement)

These results highlight the significant advantages of Apple's unified memory architecture and suggest that the M1 Max would excel in memory-intensive workloads, particularly those involving random access patterns or requiring low latency responses.

### Recommendations

For workloads requiring:

1. High-performance random access: M1 Max shows clear advantages
2. Low-latency operations: M1 Max provides significantly better response times
3. Sequential data processing: M1 Max offers superior bandwidth

The M1 Max would be particularly well-suited for:

- Database operations
- Real-time data processing
- Memory-intensive scientific computing
- High-performance data analysis workflows
